JLNotebookView
==============

This is a view that resembles a paper notebook. It is the same view I
used in [@freshlistapp](http://twitter.com/freshlistapp). Pretty simple
right now but I plan to add checkboxes and a view for creating items.

Usage:
------

There is an example provided in the Demo project.

TODO:

* add check boxes for marking items off
